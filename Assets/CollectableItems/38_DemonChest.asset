  Descriptions:
  - Please bring me back the demon's loot. He hides in in a chest and I must have
    it.
  - I found a special treasure chest earlier but I was slain before I could grab
    it. Please get it for me!
  - Please get me some treasure, the best you can find. I won't settle for anything
    but.
