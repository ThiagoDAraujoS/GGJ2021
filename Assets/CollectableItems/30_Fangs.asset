  Descriptions:
  - I've lost some verry nice beast fangs in the dungeon. Please return them to me.
  - If I don't get these fangs back how will people believe I slayed such a monstruous
    beast. Please get them back for me.
  - I slayed the beast but got defeated before I could collect its fangs. Bring them
    to me please.
